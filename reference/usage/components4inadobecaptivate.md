# Bodylight.js-Components in Adobe Captivate

Adobe Captivate supports high level web content. Unfortunately not particular components can be added directly, however adding 
existing HTML or MD pages as Web Objects is possible.
  
Select `Objects -> Web` and type address of selected component page E.g. `https://bodylight.physiome.cz/Bodylight.js-Components/#index=doc/usersguide.md&shownav=false`
 This will disable navigation and shows only the content.
