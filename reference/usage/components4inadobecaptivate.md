# Bodylight.js-Components in Adobe Captivate

Adobe Captivate supports high level web content. Unfortunately not particular components can be added directly, however adding 
existing HTML as Web Objects is possible.
  
Select `Objects -> Web` and type location of web simulator page E.g. `https://bodylight.physiome.cz/Bodylight-Scenarios/hemodynamics/#hemo6pv.cs.md`
