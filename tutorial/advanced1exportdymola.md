# Export Model to FMU in Dymola

In this step we will export a Modelica model into FMU version 2.0 in Co-Simulation mode using Dymola tool. If you use Open Modelica tool, skip to next section.
 
# Start Dymola tool

* Start Dymola (tested in version 2019).

# Check License

You may need at least "Binary Mode Export" or "Source Code Generation" license in order to export FMU with source codes.

* Check appropriate license in `Help -> License -> Detail` as seen in this screenshot:
